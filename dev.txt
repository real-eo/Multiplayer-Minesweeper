BUGS:
+ "Quick reveal" misplaced flag bug
+ Stop tiles from chaning color after game is over, happens due to the cursor, both local and LAN
+ After local cursor overlapps another players cursor, the tile gets reset so that it doesn't show the initial player's cursor color, but the default color
+ Recoloring cursor bug
- Packet loss-, desynced game bug
+ LAN player deselect square bug
+ Fix so that GridX & GridY aren't swapped
+ Fix so that the clock resets on restart without needing "first click" update
+ Fix so that an exception doesn't get raised when moving off a tile while holding down a mouse button
+ Player connections not getting closed and cleared before restart
+ Fix double connect when reconnecting after game reset
- Fix so players can share cursor colors
? Multiple "game over" pop-ups presenting at times (Bug stopped happening after killing buttons on restart??)
+ Fix so that when clicking a button while using a skin, the button doesn't become partially white
+ Fix so changing screen mode after restart doesn't mess up button textures
+ Fix so that restarting kills- or changes previous buttons, rather than just creating new ones
% Loading screen not getting properly hidden after stopping (It only removes the animation sprite for now, so if i add more to the loading screen, that has to be cleared as well. Best would be to hide the entire loading screen frame)
% Loading screen not being scaled correctly when in window mode (It sorta works)
+ Loading screen not stopping correctly upon restart
- Rewrite menu-button textures to only take use of one button texture, instead of one for each button
