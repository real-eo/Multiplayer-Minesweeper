# Multiplayer Minesweer
It is what it sounds like, a multiplayer UDP minesweeper client written in python. This project is still a massive WIP (check "dev.txt" for more info) but the core functionality still works for both singleplayer and multiplayer; - albeit with some minor bugs and missing features, particularly in the menus.

### settings.ini
**Currently missing documentation**, - but i feel like a lot of the settings are self-explainitory
